# Data Structures

This folder contains implementations of fundamental data structures commonly used in programming and technical interviews.

## Contents

- Arrays and dynamic arrays
- Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks and queues
- Trees (binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.)
- Heaps (min-heap, max-heap, priority queues)
- Hash tables and hash maps
- Graphs (adjacency list, adjacency matrix)
- Tries (prefix trees)
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

## Purpose

This directory provides clean implementations of essential data structures with comprehensive documentation. Each implementation includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal operations along with complexity analysis. These implementations serve as reference material for coding interviews and algorithm design.
