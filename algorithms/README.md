# Algorithms

This folder contains algorithm implementations and solutions to algorithmic problems.

## Contents

- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (binary search, linear search, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, shortest path, etc.)
- Dynamic programming solutions
- Greedy algorithms
- String algorithms
- Mathematical algorithms

## Purpose

This directory serves as a collection of fundamental algorithm implementations for technical interview preparation and coding practice. Each algorithm includes detailed comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.
